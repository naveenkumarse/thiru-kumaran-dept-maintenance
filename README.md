## About the Project <a name="about-project"></a>
The web app is used by many local financial institutions for their fund, debit/credit management. Developed this Microservices-based web application using Spring Boot and Node for the backend servers, with PostgreSQL and MongoDB as the databases. Transformed the application into a Progressive Web App (PWA) with push notifications to enhance user experience and engagement for over 1000 daily users.
**Note:** The application's backend infrastructure is constructed utilizing Node.js and Spring Boot technologies. As it is commercial software, the underlying codebase is not publicly accessible.
